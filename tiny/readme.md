# The tiny banner

This is an example of a tiny react app dat can be loaded with a single file, take a example ould be a little banner that can be loaded on therd party website.

I do think that loading a library for this souch little functionality is like dropping bombs on ants, this functionality can be acceaved using vanilla javascript only.
